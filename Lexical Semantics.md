# Lexical Semantics

- It is the branch of Linguistics, that studies the meanings of words and the relationships between words in a language.
- Representation of words is a string of words or index in a vocabulary.

**Lemma** :

- A lemma is the base, dictionary form of a word.
- A lemma may have multiple meanings.

eg :  "mouse" is the lemma for mouse, mice

**Sense** :

- A sense is one of the specific meanings of that word.

eg : mouse

It means:
- A device that controls cursor
- a rodent

### Relationship between word senses

**Synonym** : 2 words are called synonyms, if they have identical senses.

eg: 
```
1. couch, sofa
2. big, large
3. obey, behave
```

**Antonym** : 2 words are called antonyms, if they have opposite senses.

eg: 
```
1. dark, light
2. short, long
3. up, down
```

The four important aspects of Relationships between word senses are:
1. Word similarity
2. Word Relatedness
3. Semantic field and frame
4. connotation

### Word similarity

2 words may not be synonyms, but they might mean the same i.e., they may belong to the same category.

eg : 
```
cat,dog --> not synonyms
```
but they belong to the same category i.e., pet animals.

### Word Relatedness

2 words may not be similar but they are related to each other.

eg : 
```
coffee, cup --> related
coffee, tea --> similar
```

### Semantic Field and Frame

**Semantic Field** : It is a set of words, which covers a particular domain

eg: hospital --> doctor, nurse, injection, syringe

**Semantic Frame** : It has semantic roles and words in the sentence take on these roles.

eg: Sam bought book from John.

```
buyer  :  Sam

```

### Connotation(sentiment):
